# ifcOWL-Sensor-Data-Processing
 Comprehensive guidance for sensor data processing and visualization using IfcOpenShell and the rdflib library

## Table of Contents

- **Step 1: Installing the rdflib Library**

  Begin by Installing the rdflib library.

  > Note: If using this code locally, ensure you have JupyterIFCRenderer installed, which can be achieved through conda. Alternatively, in a Jupyter Notebook environment, the library may be readily available.

- **Step 2: Loading and Visualizing IFC Models**

  Immerse yourself in the world of IFC models using the JupyterIFCRenderer, enabling you to load and interactively visualize these complex structures.

  

- **Step 3: Processing RDF Data for Sensor Information**

  Embark on a journey of discovery by selecting spaces interactively and importing RDF data from a file. Learn the art of extracting vital information about rooms and their associated sensors through the use of SPARQL queries. See how to display comprehensive information about selected rooms and their corresponding sensors.

This repository is your go-to resource for those interested in working with RDF data in IfcOpenShell, whether for educational purposes or as a reference for ifcOWL data processing tasks.
